# Temperate

A temperature converter program made with 64-bit x86 assembly, using NASM. It is not as easy as I thought it would be.

> This program does not work as intended. It has segmentation faults and other issues.
> Please help me fix it!

## Usage

1. Run `bash compile.sh` to compile the code.
2. Run `./temperate` to run the program.
